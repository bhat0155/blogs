The power of consistency

One of my favourite authors, Naval Ravikanth said "When building habits, choose consistency over content.

The best book is the one you can't put down.

The best exercise is the one you enjoy doing every day.

The best health food is the one you find tasty.

The best work is the work you'd do for free."

Consistency in my books is the 8th wonder of this world. It complements itself with the compounding effect to make miracles.

"It wasn't bought or given. It was forged through discipline."

After reading Atomic habits, I was really charged up. It was during this time, I was watching "Seinfeld". I read a few articles about Jerry Seinfeld.

In order to become a good comedian, he wrote jokes everyday. The jokes did not have to be good. The only rule was there must be 0 days off.

He created a grid, where he used to mark an "X" with the days he followed this practice and eventually became good at it.

I too followed that. It could be anything. For me, it was dance. I did it regularly and lost 25 kgs.

I have formed many habits such as coding, swimming, running, meditating with the help of this method.

Believe me, you can achieve anything with consistency.

And By the way, I made an app about this concept: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.xeffect.ca/app">Xeffect</a>
